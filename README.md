# Sock

A (lightweight) TUI client for [nin0chat](https://chat.nin0.dev). Built with sticks and stones ([ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) & [terminal-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-kit)).

A project for me to practice my programming abilities. Not to be taken seriously! All very temporary!

## How to use

TBD when the project functions as intended

## Roadmap

- Finish messaging
- Add commands to control client
